You are working at <b>Big Company A®</b>, you feel that whatever you are working on won’t ultimately have any impact. Hey, maybe it won’t. When you have so much resources you can <i>throw shit at the wall</i>. Working at startups is different. You don’t have a big pile of manure, you have darts. Every throw must be calculated.
